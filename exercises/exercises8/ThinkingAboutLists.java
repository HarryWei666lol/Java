	// Examples List<Color>:
//	Rainbow..., order is important
//	Want to paint a room and use colors in a particular order
//	
//	Traffic Light: green, yellow, red
//	
//	Color of eyes of people as they walk into the room:
//		blue, brown, brown, blue, green

    // Examples List<Account>

//	
//	List of accounts from which funds should be taken, should the primary account overdraw
		
	// Roulette wheel - numbers 0 to 36:
//	   13, 24, 0 ,13, ---
//  List<Integer> may be the right thing but
//    
//  Some wheels have 00, 0000, 000, and so on
//  List<String> could be needed in those cases
//    
    // Example where List<Boolean> is useful;
//	coin toss:  heads or tails as outcome
//	   
//	Use List<Boolean> to record whether each toss in turn is a heads( or not)
//	   true, true, false, true
	
    // If we have a List<?> - what might we do with it

//  Add something to the list to beginning, or end, or maybe in the middle
//  Delete something from the list
//  the thing I delete might be anywhere
//  Does my List contain something
//  Join two lists together
//  Determine what's in one list but not the other
//
